# TimeseriesForecasting
Shiny app to apply time series algorithms on univariate data and get the best fit for predictions.


######### This is used to apply various time series models like ARIMA, HoltWinters, ETS, Naive, RandomWalk, Cubicspline and others
Based upon all these models, we would get the best fit based upon minimum MAPE and BIC value,
